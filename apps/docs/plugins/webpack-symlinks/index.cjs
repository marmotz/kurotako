/**
 * Local Docusaurus plugin: disable webpack symlink resolution.
 *
 * The monorepo is installed with Bun, whose store layout
 * (`node_modules/.bun/<pkg>@<ver>/node_modules/<pkg>` + symlinks) makes webpack
 * resolve the same module under many real paths when `resolve.symlinks` is left
 * on its default (`true`). That multiplies the module graph until the build
 * exhausts memory. Pinning `resolve.symlinks: false` keeps every dependency at a
 * single identity. See backlog/features/docs-site/technical.md (Bun fallback).
